# elastic-ai.runtime.c

## Prerequisites

* cmake >= 3.2.1
* gcc or clang

The project does out-of-source builds in the `build` directory. It does not need to be created manually if you use the `test.sh` shell script.

## Unit Tests

Unit Tests use [Unity]() as a testing framework, which will be fetched automatically by cmake.

## Shell Scripts

Build and run tests: `test.sh`
